        <!-- These are ideas for the page-->
        <p style="color: #9933ff; font-family: sans-serif;">
            New idea: I host embodiment peer groups once a week for 
            different demographics that i relate to and want to 
            work with. 
        </p>

            <a href="page2.html">Embodied parenting,</a> 
            <a href="page3.html">Embodied chronic conditions 
            (illness, pain, etc),</a> 
            <a href="page4.html">Embodied professionals</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Those be free and will be on the main page but will need a link to an additional page for more details
Then theres embodied dialogue facilitation and mediation services for a charge but will need a separate link with info
So may need 4 pages instead of 3, front page that says all this, then 2 info pages, then contact us page.
If there is a way to get people registered by providing an email so attendance can be gauged that would be ideal. If it needs to be through a different service than the website though that will be fine
